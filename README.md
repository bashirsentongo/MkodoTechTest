## Design

I designed the task because start with having a service that parses the json and returns the draws. Then manupilate the data and create a list that displays the data. Also added a detail view that has a few details for each draw. 

## Architecture 

I used MVVM which makes it quite easy to separate the UI from the business logic.

With always having the app's scalability in mind, i created an extension and a reusable View that i use to reuse so i can as much less code as i can and i don't have to redo the same thing again. 


## Comments 

I was not able to complete all the additional tasks. I would definitely try my best to do them if i had more time.
